= An Introduction to Docs-as-Code

by Sean Marquez (& contributors)

== When documentation is good

* Docs are up-to-date
* Docs are easy to navigate
* Docs are easy to maintain

== When documentation is bad

* Docs are not up-to-date
* Docs are hard to navigate 
* Docs are hard to maintain

== What is a _Docs as Code_ approach?

Documentation as Code (_Docs as Code_) refers to a philosophy that you should be writing documentation with the same tools as code.

== Advantages to a _Docs as Code_ approach

* Writers integrate better with development teams
* Developers will often write a first draft of documentation
* You can block merging of new features if they donâ€™t include documentation, which incentivizes developers to write about features while they are fresh

== To adopt a _Docs as Code_ approach, consider the following...

* _Language_
* _Toolchain_
* _Methodology_

== Language

* _Markup language_ used to write the docs

 e.g., Markdown, ReStructuredText, Asciidoc, LaTex 

* _Template language_, a superset of a markup language, used to format the docs

 e.g., Liquid, Jinja2, Handlebars

* _Source language_ of the toolchain used to render the docs

 e.g., Ruby for Asciidoctor, Python for Sphinx

== Toolchain

* Issue Tracker

 e.g., Jira, GitHub, GitLab

* Conversion Engine / Static Site Generator

 e.g., Sphinx, Asciidoctor, Hugo

* Distributed version control system

 e.g., git

* CI/CD service & publishing platform

 e.g., TravisCI, GitHub Actions | GitHub Pages, ReadTheDocs, Netlify

 Some publishing platforms have CI/CD services built-in

== Methodology

* _Docs-Driven-Development_

 Write your docs first, then implement what you documented

* Agile Development Practice

 e.g., scrum, kanban

* Code (Docs) Reviews

 Have someone review your docs (e.g., as a pull request on GitHub)

== Example Projects that use a Docs-as-Code Approach

* NodeJS
